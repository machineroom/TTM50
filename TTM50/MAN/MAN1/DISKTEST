NAME
     disktest - Transtech TTM50 SCSI TRAM disk test utility

SYNOPSIS
     disktest [ <iserver arguments> ] [ -h ] [ -v ] [ -c ]  [  -i
     id ] [ -l lun ]

DESCRIPTION
     The disktest utility is used to perform tests on a disk con-
     nected to a Transtech TTM50 SCSI TRAM.

     During the course of the tests, up to 1MB of data is written
     to  the  disk  and  then  it is read back again.  Backup any
     important data from the tested disk before running  disktest
     as this may well be overwritten.

     Ensure that the TTM50 is the first processor  in  the  Tran-
     sputer  network as iserver is used to load and run the Tran-
     sputer executable disktest.btl on the TTM50.

OPTIONS

     -v   Verbose mode.

     iserver command line arguments can also be used.
