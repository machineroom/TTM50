NAME
     flash - Transtech TTM50 flash EPROM programming utility

SYNOPSIS
     flash [ <iserver arguments> ] [ -h ] [ -v ] [ <filename> ]

DESCRIPTION
     The flash utility is used to  program  the  Transtech  TTM50
     SCSI  TRAM  flash  EPROM.  This allows the TTM50 to function
     standalone, that is automatically boot  itself  after  reset
     using the Transputer's boot from ROM mode.

     The data to write into the TTM50 is taken from the .hex file
     filename as produced by the Inmos ieprom utility.

     Ensure that the TTM50 is the first processor  in  the  Tran-
     sputer  network as iserver is used to load and run the Tran-
     sputer executable flash.btl on the TTM50.

     A 12V supply is required to program the TTM50  flash  EPROM.
     Set this to 0V using a jumper when not programming the flash
     EPROM.

OPTIONS
     -h   Print help message.

     -v   Verbose mode.

     <filename>
          Name of the hex file.

     iserver command line arguments can also be used.

ENVIRONMENT
     The environment variable ISERVER should be set to  the  full
     pathname of the Inmos iserver server program.
