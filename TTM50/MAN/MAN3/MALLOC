NAME
     scsi_malloc, scsi_free - Allocate and free memory

SYNOPSIS
     #include <scsi.h>

     void *scsi_malloc( size_t size );
     void scsi_free( void *ptr );

DESCRIPTION
     The function scsi_malloc allocates memory on  the  optimised
     for  availability for SCSI.  On the SCSI TRAM this allocates
     off-chip memory as the  Transputer  on-chip  memory  is  not
     available for DMA by the SCSI controller chip.

     If data is specified to the function scsi_command  which  is
     unavailable  to  the  SCSI  controller then its contents are
     copied to or from memory (depending on the value  of  flags)
     which is allocated using scsi_malloc.

     The   function   scsi_free   frees   memory   allocated   by
     scsi_malloc.

     In target routines the data parameter of the  target  struc-
     ture   should   only   point   to   memory  allocated  using
     scsi_malloc.

PARAMETERS
     size Size in bytes of the memory to allocate.

     ptr  Pointer to memory previously allocated by scsi_malloc.

RETURN VALUE
     The function scsi_malloc returns NULL if memory could not be
     allocated or a pointer to the memory allocated on success.
