NAME
     scsi_printf - SCSI library debug message function

SYNOPSIS
     #include <scsi.h>

     extern int (*scsi_printf)( const char *fmt, ... );

DESCRIPTION
     Pointer to an application defined function used by the  SCSI
     library to report error messages.

     When the SCSI system detects an error, it calls the function
     pointed to by scsi_printf (if not NULL).  A user application
     can set this pointer (for instance to point to the  function
     printf) allowing user applications to display any error mes-
     sages.

PARAMETERS
     fmt  Format string as used by printf.

     ...  Values to be formatted into the message as  defined  by
          fmt.

RETURN VALUE
     Returns the value returned by the  function  pointed  to  be
     scsi_printf.

NOTES
     The function used to  handle  error  messages  must  be  re-
     entrant.

     It is possible in certain circumstances for  error  messages
     to be generated during SCSI commands which subsequently com-
     plete successfully.
