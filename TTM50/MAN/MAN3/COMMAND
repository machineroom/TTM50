NAME
     scsi_command - Perform SCSI command

SYNOPSIS
     #include <scsi.h>

     int scsi_command( struct scsi_address *address,
      struct scsi_command *command );

DESCRIPTION
     Perform a SCSI command on the specified SCSI  target  device
     and logical unit.

     Only one outstanding SCSI command is allowed at a  time  per
     logical unit on a device.  This function blocks if more than
     one command is outstanding.

     It is recommended  that  the  function  scsi_find_device  is
     called  prior  to  using scsi_command for the first time for
     the specified target device and logical unit.

PARAMETERS
     address
          Pointer to a structure specifying the SCSI id  and  the
          logical unit number (lun) of the target device on which
          the SCSI command is to be performed.

     command
          Pointer to SCSI command structure.

     The elements of the scsi_command structure are:

     cdb  Pointer to command descriptor block specifying the SCSI
          command to perform.

     cdb_len
          Length of command descriptor block.

     data Pointer to data for the SCSI command.

     data_len
          Length of data.

     residue
          Length of data (as specified by  the  SCSI  saved  data
          pointer) not transferred during command.

     status
          SCSI status of completed command.

     flags
          Flags for command.  See below.

     timeout
          Timeout in seconds for the command.  Zero specifies  no
          timeout.

     The flags parameter is a logical or of the following:

     SFLAG_DATA_IN
          Data is to be transferred from the target.

     SFLAG_DATA_OUT
          Data is to be transferred to the target.

     SFLAG_NO_DISCONNECTS
          Disable disconnects during command.

     SFLAG_NEGOTIATE_SYNCHRONOUS
          Force negotiation  of  the  synchronous  data  transfer
          rate.

     SFLAG_NO_ATN
          Don't assert ATN  on  selection.   Implicitly  disables
          disconnects.

RETURN VALUE
     Returns zero on completing  the  SCSI  command.   Returns  a
     negative  value  as  defined in scsi.h on failing to perform
     the SCSI command.

     If the SCSI command has completed but has  failed  for  some
     reason  (as  defined  by  the target) then the function will
     return zero but the status field of  the  command  structure
     will  be  non-zero.  The residue field of the command struc-
     ture may also be non-zero indicating that  not  all  of  the
     data has been transferred between the TRAM and the target as
     requested.
