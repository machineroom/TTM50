NAME
     scsi_find_device - Find SCSI device information

SYNOPSIS
     #include <scsi.h>

     struct scsi_device *scsi_find_device( struct scsi_address *address );

DESCRIPTION
     Finds information on the specified SCSI  target  device  and
     logical unit.

     On initialisation or after a bus or device reset performs  a
     TEST  UNIT READY command with synchronous data transfer rate
     negotiation and an INQUIRY command.

     Device specific commands are performed and device parameters
     obtained from the target:

     Direct access
          For direct access devices (e.g. disks),  a  START  STOP
          UNIT command is performed to ensure that the disk motor
          is switched on, then the last block  address  and  size
          are determined using the READ CAPACITY command.

     Sequential access
          For sequential access devices (e.g. tapes), the minimum
          and  maximum  block sizes are determined using the READ
          BLOCK LIMITS command.

     CD-ROM
          For CD-ROM devices the last seek block size and address
          (which may be after the last readable block address) is
          determined using the READ CD-ROM CAPACITY command.

PARAMETER
     address
          Pointer to a structure specifying the target device  id
          and logical unit number.

RETURN VALUE
     Returns a pointer to a structure defined in scsi.h  contain-
     ing  information on the SCSI target device and logical unit.
     Returns NULL on error.
