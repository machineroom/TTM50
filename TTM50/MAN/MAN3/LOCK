NAME
     scsi_lock, scsi_unlock - Lock or unlock SCSI system

SYNOPSIS
     #include <scsi.h>

     void scsi_lock( void );
     void scsi_unlock( void );

DESCRIPTION
     These functions lock and unlock the  SCSI  system.   In  the
     locked state no other process can access the SCSI system.

     These functions are called internally by other SCSI  library
     functions.   The only legitimate use by the user are in tar-
     get callback functions where after a disconnect  scsi_unlock
     can be used to enable other outstanding SCSI transactions to
     proceed.  The function scsi_lock should be called  prior  to
     reselection or aborting the target transaction.

     In the locked state it is guaranteed that only  one  process
     at a time can call the target callback function.
