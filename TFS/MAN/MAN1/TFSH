NAME
     tfsh - Transtech File System shell utilities

SYNOPSIS
     tfsh [dev] [-n] [ cmd args ... ]


DESCRIPTION
     tfsh is a convenient set of utilities for  using  the  Tran-
     stech File System from the host machine.  It has an interac-
     tive mode, in which a prompt is given and commands are  read
     from  the  standard  input, and a mode in which a command is
     taken from the tfsh command line.

     When tfsh is executed without  any  arguments  (or  with  an
     iserver device specifier only), it logs onto the file system
     using your current user and group IDs, and  changes  to  the
     directory given in the environment variable TFS_HOME.  Under
     DOS, the user and group IDs are taken from  the  environment
     variables TFS_UID and TFS_GID.

     The arguments are as follows:

     dev  Any options recognised by  iserver  can  be  given,  to
          indicate which device to use.

     -n   Don't mount the file system or  logon.   This  must  be
          used  if  you  wish  to  format  a  disk  or make a new
          filesystem.

     cmd args ...
          The given command is executed. tfsh terminates when the
          command is complete.  Interactive mode is not entered.

COMMANDS
     Command lines are processed before being executed to substi-
     tute  filenames  in arguments containing * or ?.  Such argu-
     ments are expanded into a list of filenames by  replacing  *
     with  zero or more characters, and ? with any single charac-
     ter.  If no filenames match the pattern, the  command  fails
     with an error message.

     The following commands are accepted. Optional arguments  are
     in  square  brackets.  Arguments in angle brackets represent
     variable arguments, those not in angle  brackets  should  be
     typed in literally. Three dots indicates that the last argu-
     ment can be repeated any number of times.

     exit or quit
          The interactive session is terminated.

     help A help screen is displayed, giving the command syntax.

tfsh(1)                        TFS                        tfsh(1)



     format
          Format the disk.  This will distroy all information  on
          the  disk,  and  is almost never necessary.  Most disks
          are supplied pre-formatted.  This command can  only  be
          given when the prompt is "not mounted".

     mkfs <inodes>
          Make a new file system on the disk. This  will  distroy
          all  information on the disk.  It is required the first
          time TFS is run on a disk. <inodes> is a decimal number
          giving  the maximum number of files or directories that
          can be stored on the disk. A value  of  about  5000  is
          recommended.   This  command can only be given when the
          prompt is "not mounted".

     mount [ fsck ]
          Mount the file  system.   If  the  "fsck"  argument  is
          given, a file system check is always performed.  If the
          "fsck" argument is not given, a file  system  check  is
          only  performed  if the previous use of the file system
          did not terminated cleanly, and for the first mount  of
          a  newly created file system.  This command can only be
          given when the prompt is "not mounted".

     sync [ <blocks> ]
          The state of the file system is  written  back  to  the
          disk, ensuring that all data written so far is recover-
          able if the file system is terminated unexpectedly.  If
          a  decimal number of blocks is given, a partial sync of
          that number of blocks is performed.

     logon <uid> <gid>
          Log onto the file system with the given user and  group
          IDs.  This command can only be given when the prompt is
          "not logged on".

     mkdir <path> ...
          Make one of more directories.  The path up to  the  new
          directory  must exist, and have appropriate permissions
          for creation of the directory.  The new directories are
          given  read, write and search permission for the owner,
          and read and search permissions for the group and  oth-
          ers.

     cd <path>
          Change directory to the given  directory.   The  prompt
          changes to display the current directory.

     pwd  Print the current directory.

     ls [ <path> ... ]
          List files or directories.  If no arguments are  given,

tfsh(1)                        TFS                        tfsh(1)



          the  current  directory  is listed. If an argument is a
          file, information on the file is printed.  If the argu-
          ment is a directory, the contents of that directory are
          listed.  The listing is similar  to  that  of  "ls  -l"
          under  unix,  giving  the  access modes, number of hard
          links, the owner's user and group IDs, size  in  bytes,
          modification date and the name of the file.

     download <hostfile> ...  <tfspath>
          Copies files from the host to the TFS. If <tfspath>  is
          not  an existing directory, then only one host file may
          be specified,  and  it  is  copied  to  <tfspath>.   If
          <tfspath> exists as a file, it is overwritten.

          If <tfspath> is a directory, then more  than  one  host
          file  may  be specified, and they are copied to the TFS
          directory, retaining the last component of their names.
          Host directories cannot be copied, and filename substi-
          tution is not performed on host  files.  However,  when
          tfsh is invoked from a Unix shell, with a download com-
          mand on the command line, then Unix filename  substitu-
          tion  can be performed to get a list of host filenames.
          To copy complete directory trees, use the tar command.

     upload <tfsfile> ... <hostpath>
          Copies files from  TFS  to  the  host.   If  <hostpath>
          exists  as a directory, then one or more <tfsfile>s are
          copied into it, retaining the last component  of  their
          pathname.   If  <hostpath> is not a directory, only one
          TFS file may be given.

          Filename substitution may be used to obtain a  list  of
          files  to  upload.   However,  directories  may  not be
          uploaded. To copy complete directory trees, use the tar
          command.

     rm [-r] <path> ...
          Remove the given files.  If -r is  given,  then  direc-
          tories and their contents are removed, otherwise direc-
          tories are not removed.

     rmdir <path> ...
          Remove directories. The path must be  an  empty  direc-
          tory.

     source <cmdfile>
          The <cmdfile> is read from the host, and  its  contents
          are  executed  as tfsh commands.  Note that the command
          file exists on the host, not on the TFS.  During execu-
          tion,  command-line prompts are not given, and the com-
          mands are not echoed to the screen.

     ln <filename> <linkname>
          Create a hard link to an existing file.

     mv <files> ... <path>
          Move or rename files or directories.  If  <path>  is  a
          directory,  the  <files> are moved into that directory.
          If <path> does not exist, only one <file> may be given,
          and  it  is  renamed  as <path>.  If <path> exists as a
          file, then the command fails.  Directories may also  be
          renamed  or moved, and their contents are automatically
          moved.

     cp [-r] <files> ... <path>
          Copy files or directories. If <path>  is  a  directory,
          the  <files>  are copied into that directory. If <path>
          does not exist, only one <file> may be given, and it is
          copied to <path>.  If <path> exists as a file, the file
          is overwritten.  Directories, and their  contents,  are
          only copied if the -r option is given.

     du [-s] [ <path> ... ]
          Prints amount of disk space  used  by  directories  and
          their  sub-directories.  If no arguments are given, the
          current directory is used.  If the -s option is  given,
          disk space used by sub-directories is not printed.

     chmod <mode> <files>
          Change the access permissions of  the  given  files  or
          directories.  The mode argument is an octal number giv-
          ing the permission to read, write and execute or search
          for the owner, group and others users.

     find <path> ... [ -type f|d ] -print
          Prints names of files or directories, recursively  des-
          cending  the  directory  structure.   If  "-type  f" is
          given, only files are printed,  and  if  "-type  d"  is
          given,  only  directories  are  printed. Otherwise both
          files and directories are printed.

     tar c|x[v][f <tarfile>] <paths> ...
          Create or extract standard tar format files. The  first
          letter  of  the  first  argument  specifies  whether to
          create (c) or extract  (x).  The  modifier  'v'  causes
          information  on each file or directory to be printed as
          it is processed. The modifier 'f' causes the next argu-
          ment  to  be used as the name of the tarfile to be read
          or written.  The tarfile name  is  interpreted  on  the
          host, not on the TFS disk.  If no tarfile is specified,
          the standard input or standard output are used,  allow-
          ing the command to be used in pipes from Unix.

          Under Unix, the tarfile should not be  a  tape  device,

          because the blocking factor may be wrong. It is best to
          pipe the output through dd(1) to control  the  blocking
          factor.

     df   Print the amount of disk space available.  The  display
          shows  the  total size of the disk, the amount of space
          used, the amount free, and the  percentage  used.   The
          second line shows the total number of inodes (slots for
          files or directories), the number used, the number free
          and the percentage used.

     offline
          Terminate the shell, having  put  the  disk  "offline".
          That  is  to  say,  the drive motor is stopped and (for
          removable media devices) media removal is allowed.  The
          motor  may  be  restarted by running tfsh again, or any
          other program that uses tfs.

ENVIRONMENT
     TFS_HOME
          Initial directory in the TFS directory structure.

     TFS_UID
          User ID (decimal number) (DOS systems only).

     TFS_GID
          Group ID (decimal number) (DOS systems only).

BUGS
     Certain character sequences on the command line  are  inter-
     preted  by  iserver, limiting the commands that can be given
     on the command line. The sequence "/s" or "-s" cannot appear
     as  part of a file name on the tfsh command line.  As a wor-
     karound, create a temporary file containing the desired com-
     mands, and execute it with "tfsh source tmpfile".
