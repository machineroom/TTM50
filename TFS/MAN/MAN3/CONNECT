NAME
     tfs_connect,  tfs_disconnect  -  start/stop  connection   to
     remote TFS server

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_connect(Channel *to_tfs, Channel *from_tfs,
               int uid, int gid, int auth)

     int tfs_disconnect(int pid)


DESCRIPTION
     These  functions  are  used  when  the  remote  TFS  library
     (rtfs.lib)  is  being  used in conjuction with a TFS server.
     The only differences between the remote TFS  and  local  TFS
     are in the initialization and termination procedures.

     Code running with the remote library can not call  tfs_init,
     tfs_mount, tfs_logon, tfs_logoff or tfs_terminate.  The ini-
     tialization, mounting and termination of the file system  is
     performed by the server, and there is no equivalent to these
     routines in the remote library.  tfs_connect is analogous to
     tfs_logon, and tfs_disconnect is analogous to tfs_logoff.

     tfs_connect takes parameters specifying a pair  of  channels
     for  communication with the server, and the user- and group-
     id. "auth" is a intended as a security  measure  to  control
     access  to  the  file system. It is ignored by tfserver, but
     must be used where the TFS server may be accessed by several
     users.

     tfs_connect returns an integer, which must be  used  as  the
     "pid"  for all the other routines in the remote TFS library.
     A value of -1 is returned on error.

     tfs_disconnect closes down the  conversation  with  the  TFS
     server, returning zero on success and -1 on failure.

     tfs_connect is not applicable to the local TFS library.
