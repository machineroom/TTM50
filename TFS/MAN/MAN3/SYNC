NAME
     tfs_sync - Flushes the cache.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_sync( void )

DESCRIPTION
     All buffers in the cache that need to be updated on the disk
     are  physically  written to the disk. Immediately after per-
     forming a tfs_sync() (and until any function  that  modifies
     the  disk  is performed) the file system on the disk will be
     complete and consistent and a crash will not lead to  incon-
     sistencies  or  loss of data. Thus it is recommended to per-
     form tfs_sync() regularly.

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on error. tfs_errno indicates
     the nature of the error.
