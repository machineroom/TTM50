NAME
     tfs_lseek - Sets the file pointer.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     long tfs_lseek( int pid, int filedes, long offset,
      int whence )

ARGUMENTS
     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     int filedes
          The file descriptor to duplicate.

     long offset
          The position to set the file pointer.

     int whence
          Determines how offset is interpreted.

DESCRIPTION
     The file pointer associated with filedes is set according to
     the value of whence:

     TFS_SEEK_SET
          The file pointer is set to offset bytes relative to the
          beginning of the file.

     TFS_SEEK_CUR
          The file pointer is set to offset bytes relative to the
          current position.

     TFS_SEEK_END
          The file pointer is set to offset bytes relative to the
          end of the file.

     It is illegal to try to set  the  file  pointer  before  the
     beginning  of  the  file. The file pointer can be set beyond
     the end of the file. A read operation beyond the end of  the
     file  will  return zero bytes. Writing beyond the end of the
     file creates a hole in the file. Trying to  read  data  from
     such a hole will return bytes of zero value.

RETURNS
     Returns the new position of the file  pointer  (relative  to
     the  beginning  of  the  file)  on  success and -1 on error.
     tfs_errno indicates the nature of the error.
