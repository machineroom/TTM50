NAME
     tfs_access - Tests for existence and access permissions  for
     a file.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_access( int pid, char *path, int aperm )

ARGUMENTS
     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     char *path
          Name of the file to test.

     int aperm
          The desired access permissions.

DESCRIPTION
     tfs_access() checks if the specified logical process has the
     access  rights specified by aperm to the file (or directory)
     specified by path.  The value of aperm is either the bitwise
     OR  of  the  access  permissions  to  be  checked (TFS_R_OK,
     TFS_W_OK and TFS_X_OK) or the existence test, TFS_F_OK.

     TFS_F_OK
          Satisfied if the specified file (or directory) exists.

     TFS_R_OK
          Satisfied if the specified logical process  has  suffi-
          cient permissions to read the specified file (or direc-
          tory).

     TFS_W_OK
          Satisfied if the specified logical process  has  suffi-
          cient  permissions  to  write/update the specified file
          (or directory).

     TFS_X_OK
          Satisfied if the specified logical process  has  suffi-
          cient  permissions  to  execute  the specified file (or
          search the directory). The X-bit is implemented by  TFS
          but has no significance for regular files.

RETURNS
     If all the requested access modes are permitted, a value  of
     zero  is  returned.  If  not,  or  in  case  of error, -1 is
     returned and tfs_errno indicates the nature of the error.
