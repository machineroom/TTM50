NAME
     tfs_close - Closes a file.

SYNOPSYS
     Synopsis:

     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_close( int pid, int filedes )

ARGUMENTS
     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     int filedes
          The file descriptor of the file to close.

DESCRIPTION
     The specified file is closed and the file descriptor is  de-
     allocated. Closing a file does not ensure that any modifica-
     tions to the file actually has been written to the disk;  if
     the   file  system  is  operating  in  write  back  mode,  a
     tfs_sync() must be performed to ensure that.

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.
