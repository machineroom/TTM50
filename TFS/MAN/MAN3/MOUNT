NAME
     tfs_mount - Mounts the disk as a file system.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_mount( int do_fsck )

DESCRIPTION
     Mounts the disk as a file system. The disk  must  contain  a
     valid  file  system previously created by tfs_mkfs() and not
     already be mounted.  Before the disk is  mounted,  its  file
     system  is  checked  for consistency by a procedure known as
     fsck. Inconsistencies in the file system are likely to occur
     if  the systems crashes while there are buffers in the cache
     that need to be updated on the disk. If the system is always
     terminated  properly  with a call to tfs_terminate(), incon-
     sistencies  cannot  occur.  If  the  value  of  do_fsck   is
     TFS_DO_FSCK,  fsck  will  be  performed. If TFS_DONT_FSCK is
     specified, fsck will only be performed if  the  file  system
     was  not  terminated properly last time is was mounted or it
     was terminated with TFS_DO_FSCK (see tfs_terminate()).

     Any inconsistencies found during fsck are reported (if error
     reporting  is  turned  on)  and  corrected. Depending on the
     severity of the inconsistencies they can  lead  to  loss  of
     data.  But  fsck will always leave the file system in a con-
     sistent state. Performing fsck takes some time depending  on
     the  size  of  the disk (actually the number of inodes allo-
     cated and the number of  files  on  the  disk)  -  typically
     several minutes.

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.

AVAILABILITY
     tfs_mount is not available in the remote TFS  library,  only
     the local library.
