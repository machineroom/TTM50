     int tfs_mkfs( unsigned inodes )

ARGUMENTS
     unsigned inodes
          The maximum number of files and directories that can be
          held  in  the  file system.  A fixed amount of space on
          the disk is allocated for the inode table.

DESCRIPTION
     A new file system is created on the disk with the number  of
     inodes  specified  rounded  up to fill an integral number of
     disk blocks. All previous data on the disk is lost. The file
     system  must  have  been  initialised  by tfs_init() and not
     mounted (by tfs_mount()).

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.

AVAILABILITY

     the local library.
