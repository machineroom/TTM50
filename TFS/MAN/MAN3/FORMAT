NAME
     tfs_format - Performs a low-level format of the disk.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_format( void )

DESCRIPTION
     A format command is sent to the drive which will then format
     itself.  The drive will be formatted with its default inter-
     leave factor.

     Since most drives come pre-formatted from the  manufacturer,
     this command is rarely needed.

     The file system must have been initialised by tfs_init() and
     no  disk  may have been mounted (by tfs_mount()) before cal-
     ling tfs_format().

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.

AVAILABILITY
     tfs_format is not available in the remote TFS library,  only
     the local library.
