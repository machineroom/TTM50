NAME
     tfs_part_sync - Flushes a part of the cache.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_part_sync( int blocks )

ARGUMENTS
     int blocks
          The maximum number of blocks to be written to the disk.

DESCRIPTION
     Since the cache is quite large,  tfs_sync()  may  take  some
     time.  In  some  applications  it might not be acceptable to
     hold up the file system for as long as  it  takes  to  do  a
     tfs_sync().   tfs_part_sync()  enables  the sync to be split
     into smaller chunks.

     The number of blocks in the cache is defined by the constant
     TFS_CACHE_SIZE  (this  constant  is for information only; it
     cannot  be  changed).  Performing  n  consecutive  call   to
     tfs_part_sync()  each  with TFS_CACHE_SIZE/n as parameter is
     equivalent to one call to tfs_sync().

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.
