NAME
     tfs_read - Reads a block of data from a file.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_read( int pid, int filedes, char *buf,
      int nbytes )

ARGUMENTS
     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     int filedes
          Specifies the file to read from.

     char *buf
          A pointer to a buffer where the data is put.

     int nbytes
          How many bytes to read.

DESCRIPTION
     read() attempts to read nbytes from the  file  specified  by
     filedes at the file's current position. At most nbytes bytes
     will be read. Fewer than nbytes bytes will be  read  if  the
     end of the file is reached or an error occurs. If the opera-
     tion is successful, the file pointer will be incremented  as
     many bytes as are read; in case of error it is unaffected.

RETURNS
     The actual number of bytes read is  returned  or  -1  if  an
     error occurs. tfs_errno indicates the nature of the error.
