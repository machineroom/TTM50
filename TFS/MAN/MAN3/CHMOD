     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     char *path
          Name of the file to test.

     int perm
          The new access permissions.

DESCRIPTION
     The access permissions (the RWX-bits) of the file  specified
     by  path  is  set  to  the value perm.  The value of perm is
     specified as a bitwise OR of any combination of the  follow-
     ing values:

     TFS_S_IRUSR
          The owner of the file has read permission.

     TFS_S_IWUSR
          The owner of the file has write permission.

     TFS_S_IXUSR
          The owner of the file has execute permission. Only sig-
          nificant for directories.

     TFS_S_IRGRP
          Users (processes) in the same group as  the  file  have
          read permission.

     TFS_S_IWGRP
          Users (processes) in the same group as  the  file  have
          write permission.

     TFS_S_IXGRP
          Users (processes) in the same group as  the  file  have
          execute permission. Only significant for directories.

     TFS_S_IROTH
          Other users (processes) have read permission.

     TFS_S_IWOTH
          Other users (processes) have write permission.

tfs_chmod(3)          Transtech File System          tfs_chmod(3)



     TFS_S_IXOTH
          Other users (processes) have execute  permission.  Only
          significant for directories.

     TFS_S_ISUID and TFS_S_ISGID
          The SUID and SGID bits are implemented but not signifi-
          cant in TFS. A write to a regular file will clear these
          two bits.

     Only the owner of the file or the  super  user  may  execute
     tfs_chmod().

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.
