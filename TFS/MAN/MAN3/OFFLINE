NAME
     tfs_offline - Terminate the file system and stop the disk.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_offline( void )

DESCRIPTION
     tfs_offline provides a way of stopping the disk, and  allow-
     ing  removal  of removable media disks.  There is no need to
     call tfs_terminate after calling tfs_offline.  The disk  may
     be  started again, (with a fresh file system if the disk has
     been replaced) by calling tfs_init.

     If any processes are currently logged on,  they  are  logged
     off. All blocks are flushed to disk and the clock process is
     terminated.  After the file system is  terminated  no  other
     command may be issued to the file system, except tfs_init().

     When the disk that was put offline is next mounted,  a  file
     system check is automatically performed.

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.

AVAILABILITY
     tfs_offline is not available in the remote TFS library, only
     the local library.

BUGS
     Some SCSI disks do not stop their motor when the  stop  com-
     mand is issued.  Refer to the manual for the disk drive.
