NAME
     tfs_umask - Set file creation mask.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     u_short tfs_umask( int pid, u_short cmask )

ARGUMENTS
     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     u_short c_mask
          The new UMASK.

DESCRIPTION
     This logical process UMASK is set to c_mask.  Other bits  in
     c_mask not relevant to UMASK are ignored.

     When a new file is created, its permission bits are  set  as
     specified,  except  those  bits that are set in the process'
     UMASK.

RETURNS
     Returns the old UMASK on success. The only possible  failure
     is  if  the  specified  process  ID is invalid. In that case
     c_mask is returned and tfs_errno is set to EINVAL.
