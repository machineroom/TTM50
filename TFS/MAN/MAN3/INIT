NAME
     tfs_init - Initialise the library.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_init( unsigned fs_id, int scsi_target_id,
      int link_no, int cache_mode, time_t sys_time,
      Channel *err_chan, int err_mode )

ARGUMENTS
     unsigned fs_id
          ID assigned to this file system. In practice only  used
          for error messages.

     int scsi_target_id
          The physical SCSI ID of the disk. The LUN (Logical Unit
          Number i.e. partition) used is zero.

     int link_no
          The number [0..3] of the physical  transputer  link  on
          the file system TRAM connecting the file system TRAM to
          the SCSI TRAM.  In implementations where  TFS  runs  on
          the  SCSI  TRAM  (such as the TTM50), this parameter is
          ignored.

     int cache_mode
          Either TFS_WRITE_BACK or TFS_WRITE_THROUGH.   In  write
          through  mode  all blocks are updated physically on the
          disk immediately when they are changed. In  write  back
          mode  only  blocks  important  to file system integrity
          (inodes and indirect blocks) are  updated  immediately.
          The  less  important  blocks (data blocks and bit maps)
          are not updated until they are evicted from  the  cache
          (using a least-recently-used algorithm).

     time_t sys_time
          The system time in seconds since January 1st 1970.  The
          file  system  maintains  its own clock process which is
          initialised to this value. The file system time is used
          to time stamp file modifications.

     Channel *err_chan
          If error reporting is enabled, error messages and warn-
          ings are sent out on this channel. The protocol used is
          an integer count followed by an  array  of  characters.
          The array contains a '\0' terminator.

     int err_mode
          Either TFS_ERROR_MODE_ON or TFS_ERROR_MODE_OFF.  Deter-
          mines  whether error messages and warnings are sent out
          on err_chan or  not.  It  is  strongly  recommended  to

          arrange  for error messages to reach the operator. Only
          the foolhardiest user will ignore any  the  error  mes-
          sages  as  they all indicate a serious problem with the
          disk/file system.

DESCRIPTION
     The file system is initialised including starting  the  file
     system clock process. The disk is initialised and its physi-
     cal parameters are interrogated.

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.
