NAME
     tfs_write - Writes a block of data to a file.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_write( int pid, int filedes, char *buf,
      int nbytes )

ARGUMENTS
     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     int filedes
          Specifies the file to write to.

     char *buf
          A pointer to a buffer holding the data.

     int nbytes
          How many bytes to write.

DESCRIPTION
     write() attempts to write nbytes to the  file  specified  by
     filedes at the file's current position. At most nbytes bytes
     will be written. Fewer than nbytes bytes will be written  if
     the  end of the disk becomes full or an error occurs. If the
     operation is successful, the file  pointer  will  be  incre-
     mented  as many bytes as are written; in case of error it is
     unaffected.

RETURNS
     The actual number of bytes written is returned or -1  if  an
     error occurs. tfs_errno indicates the nature of the error.
