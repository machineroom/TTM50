NAME
     tfs_terminate - Terminate the file system.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_terminate( int do_fsck )

DESCRIPTION
     If any processes are currently logged on,  they  are  logged
     off. All blocks are flushed to disk and the clock process is
     terminated. After the file system  is  terminated  no  other
     command may be issued to the file system, except tfs_init().

     The parameter do_fsck determines whether fsck will  be  per-
     formed when the file system is mounted again. If TFS_DO_FSCK
     is specified, fsck will be performed at the next mount()  of
     this  file  system. If TFS_DONT_FSCK is specified, it signi-
     fies that a fsck isn't needed to  salvage  the  file  system
     because  the  file  system  was terminated correctly - but a
     parameter to tfs_mount() (see tfs_mount()) can demand a fsck
     anyway.

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.

AVAILABILITY
     tfs_terminate is not available in the  remote  TFS  library,
     only the local library.
