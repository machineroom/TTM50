NAME
     tfs_unlink - Removes a link to a file.

SYNOPSYS
     #include <tfs.h>

     int tfs_unlink( int pid, char *path )

ARGUMENTS
     int pid
          Process ID of the logical process.

     char *path
          Name of the link.

DESCRIPTION
     The link named by path is  removed.  If  path  is  the  last
     reference  to  a  file and no process has the file open, the
     file itself is removed; if the  file  is  open,  it  is  not
     removed  until the last file descriptor referencing the file
     is closed.

     Directories cannot  be  unlinked  but  must  be  removed  by
     tfs_rmdir().

RETURNS
     Returns zero on success and -1 on  error.   tfs_errno  indi-
     cates the nature of the error.
