DESCRIPTION
     tfserver is a transputer process  to  allow  access  to  the
     Transtech File System from other processes.  It is connected
     to each client process by a pair of channels. It  is  optim-
     ised  to  allow concurrent use from multiple processes, with
     I/O on all channels overlapped with access to the disk.

     Host channels must be connected to allow tfserver to  obtain
     the  clock  time  from the host, and to print important mes-
     sages to do with the operation of the disk.  A host  channel
     multiplexor  such  as hostmux allows the host channels to be
     shared between tfserver and user processes.  Because of  the
     number  of  channels  that  need to be connected in any non-
     trivial  system,  the  use  of  the  Inmos  Virtual  Routing
     software is strongly recommended.

     The Configuration parameters are as follows:

     from_host, to_host
          Iserver channels to host.

     to_clients, from_clients
          Arrays of channels to client processes.

tfserver.lku(2)                TFS                tfserver.lku(2)



     n_clients
          The number of client channels.

     fs_id, scsi_target_id, link_no, cache_mode
          Integer arguments passed to tfs_init(3).

     verbosity
          An integer parameter controlling the level of detail of
          messages  from the tfserver.  The higher the number the
          more information is provided. The value is  interpreted
          as follows:

            0 - no messages are ever printed.
            1 - messages critical to file system
            2 - messages critical to a client session
            3 - displays logon and logoff messages
            4 - report all error conditions, even non-fatal ones
            5 - report opening and closing of files
            6 - report all operation except read and write
            7 - report read and write operations
            8 - report request packet tags

     Note that even with message level 0, the tfserver must still
     be connected to the host by iserver channels.

     A level of 2 is recommended for normal use.   Higher  levels
     may be used for debugging.

     The tfserver is also provided in a form that can  be  linked
     with the TFS library, to port it to different SCSI interface
     hardware.  The command to do this is:

          % ilink -t8 -o tfserver.lku tfs_serv.tco tfserver.lib \
          tfs.lib ttm50.lib -f startup.lib

     where tfs.lib and ttm50.lib may be replaced  with  libraries
     appropriate for the SCSI interface.

ENVIRONMENT
     The ISEARCH environment variable should include the TFS libs
     directory.  Don't  forget the slash at the end of the direc-
     tory name.

FILES
