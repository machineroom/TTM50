		Remote TFS Example

In this example a user program is linked with rtfs.lib, and
is placed in a configuration with tfserver.  Note that the
rtfs calls are calls begining with "tfs_", and are the same
as the local TFS library.  rtfs.lib can only be linked with
user programs written in Inmos C. 

rtfs.lib gives significant bandwidth advantages over iorouter.

Virtual channel routing is required to configure this example,
and is strongly recommended for all applications using tfserver.

The number of user processes is controlled by the n_clients
variable in the configuration file.

The user program "fulltest.c" exercises the majority of tfs
function calls.
