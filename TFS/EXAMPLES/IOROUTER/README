		IOROUTER EXAMPLE
		
This example shows how to connect one or more
standard toolset programs to the TFS disk.

It uses iorouter.lku and tfserver.lku

The program requires a user tram and a TTM50, connected
in a 2-1 pipeline.  The virtual link configurer, icvconf,
is needed to configure this example, and is strongly
recommended if you intend to use tfserver or iorouter.

It runs any number of standard user programs, as separate
.lku processes on the user tram.  The number of user processes
is set by the value "n_clients" in the configuration file.

Note that for each user process, a separate iorouter is
included between the user and the hostmux.  tfserver has
n_clients clients.  This is the most efficient way of arranging
it as tfserver is multithreaded and can process requests
in parallel.

A less efficient way, that saves memory space on the user
tram, is to place the iorouter between hostmux and the host
link.  In this case tfserver has only one client, and requests
are processed one at a time.
