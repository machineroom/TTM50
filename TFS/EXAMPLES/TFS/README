		Local TFS library examples

	These example programs illustrate the use of some of
	the local TFS library calls.  They should be compiled
	and linked with tfs.lib and a library for your SCSI
	module, such as ttm50.lib.

	These programs run on the SCSI Tram itself, and it
	should be the first tram in the network.

	
	mkfs.c 		Code to make a new file system on the
			disk.  THIS WILL DESTROY ALL DATA ON 
			THE DISK.
	
	fulltest.c	Code exercising nearly all functions
			in the TFS library, and performing a
			bandwidth test.  It assumes that there
			is already a file system on the disk, so
			make one first with "tfsh -n mkfs 5000",
			or run mkfs.btl.
